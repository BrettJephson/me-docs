Lorem ipsum is a scrambled version of "De finibus bonorum et malorum," a 1st-century BC text by Cicero, with words altered, added, and removed to make it nonsensical and improper Latin. Lorem ipsum is a common placeholder text that allows designers to focus on visual presentation by providing a natural-looking block of text.

  * 27% MRR increase (from 16k to 21k)
  * We are gonna work on a bigger batch (around 1.5k)

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 17.24.45.png" alt="" width="99"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Adapt search:** We've completed and released the changes to adapt search to support adaptive content.

#### **In progress**&#x20;

**UI tweaks & fixes:** We are making changes to the UI to polish the UI before we start releasing to selected customers.

**Docs:** We are going to make changes to the Adaptive Content docs to add more details on the feature and step-by-step guides on how customers can set things up on their end to pass claims for their visitors.

#### **Next**

We are going to start releasing Adaptive content to selected customers this week.

### Editor&#x20;

We clarified the goal and how we're going to track impact of the editor project to maintain momentum.

* **Goal :** Address users feedback that the editor is painful to use, unpredictable and slow.
* **North star metric :** Reduce the amount of support requests received about the editor.
  * We get a steady average of 80 requests per month, which over the past 6 months makes the editor the 2nd worse part of our product.
  * Those requests are turned into issues in linear, we have 42 [editor-issues in the backlog](https://linear.app/gitbook-x/team/RND/view/editor-1b8a61f0e084) atm. We'll work on getting that amount down.
* **Timeline :** We give us 1 month for now and evaluate progress every week to make sure we're consistently working on the most important issues.



:rocket: **Several noticeable fixes and improvements got shipping those past 2 weeks**

From [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

* Tapping with trackpad on a hea![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2025-03-13 at 17.24.45.png>)ding block is fixed.
* Anchor section UX is fixed.
* ToC has more readable styles.
* ToC toggle button on small screens is back from the dead.
* Links normalization is fixed (new lines encoded char are now preserved).
* Page icon wasn't showing on small screen when title was long, it's fixed.

From [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

* AI in Expandable block is here

From [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")

New table rolled out to 100% as of today üéâ

* [#17034](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-x/pull/17034) - Reordering is more forgiving on your cursor‚Äôs position while dragging
* [#17002](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-x/pull/17002) - Improved design and UX of row controls (floating, sticky, and no arbitrary widths in first col)

What's next for the Table:

* [ ] Major remaining poor experience in tables is the keyboard/focus/selection management
* [ ] Better empty states for Select, Avatar, Users, Files, and Link (content-refs)



Some bug fixes üêõ

* Improved copy-paste behaviour of blocks
  * [#17015](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-x/pull/17015) - fixed a bug where some tables wouldn‚Äôt copy when they contained content-ref columns with empty cells
  * \#17026 - copying blocks outside of GitBook would show UI element's labels like ‚ÄúComment‚Äù
* Ensuring all major table-issues in the backlog are fixed in the new one
* [#16970](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-x/pull/16970) - Rows further down large tables wouldnt show cause of (missing) virtualization
* [#16917](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook-x/pull/16917) - Fixed triple-click not working as expected on (un)ordered and checkbox lists

#### State of Docs report

* Some partners have now shared the survey with their audiences, although we‚Äôre hoping more will soon.&#x20;
* The number of responses is lower than we‚Äôd like ‚Äî we‚Äôre sending another email and in-app to our full database this week to encourage more responses.
* Tal and Addison have been reaching out to partners this week to get interviews/quotes for the report
* Early results are very interesting. Steve is working on a draft of the talking points (quick screenshare)
* Branding - currently on hold whilst I focus on website updates. Latest concepts can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/design/qKNFpiJSh3dfc3kX6g6ivO/State-of-Docs?node-id=162-160\&t=hZngCKJRoYtasBc6-1)
* Website - the survey landing page is live at [stateofdocs.com](https://www.stateofdocs.com/). Currently it links to the survey on GoogleForms

If I‚Äôve missed anything, please post in the¬†#changelog channel, but otherwise we‚Äôll hold until next week
* We have a newsletter almost ready to send, but will hold off until next week to avoid spamming users.

**Interesting case from last week**\
\
**-** Taran spotted that Algolia was trialing Mintlify on GitHub\
\- We made a demo site for them and reached out: [https://algolia-docs.gitbook.io/docs](https://algolia-docs.gitbook.io/docs)\
\- They responded saying they've already signed with mintlify mainly due to some custom migration work:\
\
"Hi Louis

Thanks for reaching out. However, we have committed to a year with Mintlify so won't be looking elsewhere for at least that long,

A few things tipped us in the Mintlify direction: white glove migration on our complex sources (not just Open API and Markdown but several iterations of bespoke YAML structured content), its similarity to our existing content provision environment, and their willingness to reinstate Algolia as their search tool.

Early days in the migration yet since we've asked them to pause and tackle the trickier stuff next.

If things go badly, rest assured we're big fans of GitBook and feel it occupies a similar space in the market to Mintlify. I've been impressed with what's been going on with GitBook lately.

Regards"\
\
**Learnings:** \
\
**1. We need to be there first**\
**2. Migration and custom solutions are important for these big accounts**
