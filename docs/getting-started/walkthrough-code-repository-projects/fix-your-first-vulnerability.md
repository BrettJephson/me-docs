# Fix your first vulnerability

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have [viewed Snyk Projects](view-your-first-snyk-projects.md) and [understood their vulnerabilities](understand-your-vulnerabilities.md). You can now start to resolve these vulnerabilities.
{% endhint %}

### How can I resolve it?

When we open a Snyk Project file, we see the list of issues Snyk has found in this Project, and we can research each issue, using Snyk and other sources of information.

Different actions may be available for each vulnerability:

* Fix the vulnerability immediately, by raising a Fix PR. See [Example](fix-your-first-vulnerability.md#open-source-example-fix-this-vulnerability) below.
* Ignore the vulnerability, permanently or temporarily. See [Ignore the vulnerability](fix-your-first-vulnerability.md#ignore-the-vulnerability) below.
* Assign the vulnerability to research and fix (see [Assign fix work](assign-fix-work.md) and [Fix your first vulnerability - deeper dive](fix-your-first-vulnerability-deeper-dive.md))

{% hint style="info" %}
Actions available depend on the vulnerability and the type of scanning. See [Fix your vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/remediate-your-vulnerabilities) for more details.
{% endhint %}

### Open source example: Fix this vulnerability

{% hint style="info" %}
**Reminder**\
We use GitHub in this example, most other supported Git code repository integrations work in a similar way. See [Git repository integrations](https://docs.snyk.io/integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations).
{% endhint %}

For vulnerabilities in open source libraries, the **Fix this Vulnerability** button raises a PR to upgrade dependencies to the latest version of a package (which fixes the vulnerability, removing it from your code).

The **Open a Fix PR** screen allows you to select your PR:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (135).png>)

Your PR is selected by default, but you may wish to raise a PR to upgrade other libraries by selecting them (this list of all fixes may be overwhelming - you may only want to fix the vulnerability you’ve done the research on and know about).

Click **Open a fix PR** at the bottom of this screen to generate a fix PR:

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/image (308) (1) (1).png>)

You can then manage this change as for any other PRs for your code.

#### More information

* **Docs**: See [Fixing vulnerabilities](https://docs.snyk.io/snyk-open-source/open-source-basics/fixing-vulnerabilities) for an overview, and [Fixing and prioritizing issues](https://docs.snyk.io/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues) for more details.
* **Training**: see [Fix PRs](https://training.snyk.io/learn/course/introduction-to-the-snyk-ui/issue-fix-options/open-source-fix-advice?page=1).

### Ignore the vulnerability

Another option is to ignore a vulnerability, temporarily or permanently; for example, if we think it may not affect us, or if we think it’s a false positive. We can click **Ignore**, and make a comment to record why we’re ignoring it.

If you select to ignore, this vulnerability will not appear in the next scans for that Snyk Project.

### Fix issues for other types of scan

This example showed you how to apply a fix to an open source vulnerability, using Snyk Open Source. Depending on what you scan, you can use other Snyk products to resolve issues:

* For items built into a container, such as a Docker files, scanned by Snyk Container: see [Analysis and fixes for your images from the Snyk Web UI](../../products/snyk-container/getting-around-the-snyk-container-ui/analysis-and-remediation-for-your-images-from-the-snyk-app.md).
* For Kubernetes deployment files, terraform and other IaC files, scanned by Snyk IaC: see [Using Snyk IaC with the Web UI](../../products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/using-snyk-iac-via-web.md).
* For your own code analysis results, scanned by[ Snyk Code](../../products/snyk-code/): see [Exploring the Fix analysis page](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-code/exploring-and-working-with-the-snyk-code-results/exploring-the-vulnerability-issues-discovered-by-snyk-code/exploring-the-data-flow-and-fix-analysis-pages-of-an-issue/exploring-the-fix-analysis-page).

### What's next?

This example shows how to make a simple upgrade to a dependency, based on Snyk advice. Typically, fixes can be more complex than this.

Next, let's [take a deeper dive](fix-your-first-vulnerability-deeper-dive.md) into fixing a vulnerability in your code.
