# Walkthrough: Code Repository Projects

This walkthrough shows how to use Snyk to scan, manage and fix application vulnerabilities in your Git-based code repository, using the [Snyk Web UI](../../snyk-web-ui/).

This walkthrough uses content imported from a GitHub repository. Snyk supports all common Git-based repositories (such as GitHub, GitLab and Azure), and content from all these repositories can be added to be scanned. See [Git repository integrations](../../integrations/git-repository-scm-integrations/) for more details

#### Prerequisites: a Snyk account and imported Projects

This walkthrough assumes that you have signed up with a Snyk account, and that you have imported files into Snyk as Snyk Projects for scanning.

If not, then please see the [Getting Started](../) page for details.

### First step: see your projects

Let's start by [viewing your first project](view-your-first-snyk-projects.md).&#x20;
