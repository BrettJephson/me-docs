# View Snyk scan results

{% hint style="info" %}
**Recap**\
You have [imported a Project into Snyk](import-a-project.md), and Snyk has scanned that Project for any issues.
{% endhint %}

You can now view the results of your scan - for example:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-07-26 at 16.19.27.png>)

The scan results and available actions depend on the type of Project you scan:

* Open source libraries: see [Snyk Open Source](../products/snyk-open-source/getting-started-snyk-open-source.md).
* Your application code : see [Snyk Code](../products/snyk-code/getting-started-with-snyk-code/)
* Container images: see [Snyk Container](../products/snyk-container/getting-started-snyk-container/)
* Infrastructure as Code (IaC), Kubernetes, Helm and Terraform configuration files: see [Snyk IaC](../products/snyk-infrastructure-as-code/getting-started-snyk-iac.md)

### What's next?

Now, you can start to fix your issues. See [Fixing and prioritizing issues](../features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/).
