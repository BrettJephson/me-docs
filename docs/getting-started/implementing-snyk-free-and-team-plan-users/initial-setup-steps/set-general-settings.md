# Set General Settings

Here are some tips for settings:

### **Ignores**&#x20;

In **Settings** > **General**, you can specify who can ignore an issue in the Snyk UI.&#x20;

This is especially important for larger teams where more oversight is required or security prefers more control. Note: ignoring does not delete the issue, it just filters it and can be unignored.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**\
Only allow Snyk Admins to set ignores, and require a reason for the ignore being set.
{% endhint %}

See [Ignore issues](../../../features/fixing-and-prioritizing-issues/issue-management/ignore-issues.md) for more details.

### License policies

For Team Plan Users, you can also configure [License policies](https://docs.snyk.io/products/snyk-open-source/licenses), found under **Settings**.

See [License policies](set-general-settings.md#license-policies) for more details.
