# Create your Organization

Free and Team plan users are entitled to a single [organization](https://docs.snyk.io/user-and-group-management/managing-groups-and-organizations/whats-a-snyk-organization) in Snyk.

### Rename your Organization

When you signed up, Snyk created an organization based on your signup name. This is referred to as your "default" or "personal" organization.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
**Tip**\
****If you are creating an account to share and collaborate to use  your team or company name for the organization name. If itâ€™s for personal use, the default organization that was created when you signed up makes sense to use
{% endhint %}

If you choose to rename the display name, the URL may still reflect the original name.&#x20;

* Free users can create a new Organization, and delete their old Organization.&#x20;
* Existing customers on a paid Team/Business/Enterprise plan can request support to update their URL if they purchased their plan with the personalized default Organization.
