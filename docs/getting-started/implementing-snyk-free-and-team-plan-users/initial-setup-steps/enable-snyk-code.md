# Enable Snyk Code

[Snyk Code](../../../products/snyk-code/) enables your developers to scan their own application source code for issues.

For free plan users, or users that have purchased Snyk Code as part of a paid plan, if you wish to scan your source code, you are prompted to allow source code scanning when you first sign up to Snyk and choose a code repository.&#x20;

If you previously disabled/skipped this step, and now want to enable it, or you just want to confirm itâ€™s available:&#x20;

* Navigate to **Settings** > **Snyk Code**&#x20;
* Click the toggle to enable Snyk Code
* Click **Save Changes**

{% hint style="info" %}
If you imported projects prior to enabling, you will need to re-import them.
{% endhint %}

See [Getting started with Snyk Code](../../../products/snyk-code/getting-started-with-snyk-code/) for more details.
