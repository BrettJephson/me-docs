# Visibility

### What is visibility?

When you start to roll out Snyk, gaining visibility is the process of driving awareness on what Snyk does, why it was brought in, and how to use it. This awareness helps promote and encourage Snyk adoption in your teams. Visibility also helps with operationalizing security and getting engagement to fix issues, as well as visibility of security across your repositories or projects.

Gaining visibility can be quick and simple; when your team begin using Snyk, you can get visibility across your repositories in minutes after [signing up](../../create-a-snyk-account.md).

#### Don't get swamped

After results start appearing, Snyk may expose hundreds or even thousands of unknown vulnerabilities in your code base, especially if youâ€™ve not performed this type of testing before. The path to success is long term planning and planning your rollout in phases - very few companies are perfect!

### Achieving visibility

Visibility can be achieved in different ways. It can be as simple as:

* Integrating your most important git repositories to get engagement and awareness on the most important vulnerabilities that need to be addressed first. This also provides visibility into new issues that might get introduced with new development.&#x20;
* Enabling a Pull Request check on a very important application, so when code is submitted, the security results are immediately visible by the developer who submitted it. This allows quicker remediation, in addition to preventing insecure changes from being merged.&#x20;
* Enabling Snyk Monitor on CI/CD (non-blocking) and reviewing results

### What's next?

After your projects are onboarded and/or monitoring is started, you can work on [Prevention](prevention.md):  ensuring new development does not introduce new vulnerabilities.
