# Getting started

To start using Snyk, you need a Snyk account, and some code to scan.

### Quickstart

1. [Sign up to a Snyk account](create-a-snyk-account.md).
2. [Set up a Snyk integration](set-up-an-integration.md): give Snyk access to your code for scanning, by integrating with your source code (Git) repository.
3. [Import a Project](import-a-project.md) to scan (or run a scan locally) to identify issues.
4. [Review the results](view-snyk-scan-results.md) and take action based on the details of the issues found.

### More details

* See [Running tests](running-tests.md) for a general overview of how to use Snyk functions to run tests.
* See [Walkthrough: Code Repository Projects](walkthrough-code-repository-projects/) to read a full walkthrough of scanning and fixing vulnerabilities from content stored in a Git repository.
* See [Implementing Snyk in your teams](implementing-snyk-business-and-enterprise-plan-users.md) for details of rolling Snyk out in your teams.
