# Snyk API token permissions users can control

To set an API token to be read-only and unable to write to the platform, use a service account and set it to Group Viewer.

Service accounts at the org level have only org admin and org collaborator permissions. Thus to set a service account to view-only you must use a group level service account.

For more information see [Service accounts](../../features/user-and-group-management/structure-account-for-high-application-performance/service-accounts.md).
